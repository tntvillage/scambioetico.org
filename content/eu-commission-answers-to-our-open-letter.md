We have received the answer to [our open letter of 4th November 2009](http://blog.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/?p=4177) and we are glad to publish it.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION  
Cabinet of Mrs. Reding

The Head of Cabinet

Brussels, 12 November 2009  
RS/MS/fm D(200) 1840-A3582

Dear Mr Brini,

Many thanks for your letter of 4th November 2009 to Commissioner Viviane Reding, in which you posed questions regarding the proposed amendment 138 of the Telecoms Package, which was to be discussed in the Conciliation Delegation meeting of that same day.

As you are aware, an agreement on the EU Telecoms Reform was reached late in the evening of 4th November 2009.

This agreement was welcomed by Commissioner Reding who noted that the telecoms reform will substantially enhance consumer rights and consumer choice in Europe's telecom markets and add new guarantees ensuring the openness and neutrality of the internet.

This important development and the additional protection it gives to internet users, in no way contradicts or alters President Jos√© Manuel Barroso's and Commissioner Reding's commitment to tackle the main obstacles to a genuine digital single market in the context of the announced European Digital Agenda.

Yours sincerely,  
Rudolf Strohmeier
