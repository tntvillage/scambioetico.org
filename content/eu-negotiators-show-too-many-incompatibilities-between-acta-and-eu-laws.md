**<!--more-->**

On November the 30th, an [EU document regarding ACTA](http://blog.die-linke.de/digitalelinke/wp-content/uploads/674b-09.pdf), addressed to the United States, leaked. The document, dated 29 October 2009, a date immediately preceding the last round of negotiations held in South Korea, has been evaluated as authentic by leading experts, including the lawyer Michael Geist.

Thanks to precise references to specific sections of ACTA, we can say that almost all the previous concerns, based on additional "leakage" of documents, are sadly confirmed: among other things, ACTA seeks to impose filters on the Internet, graduated response (3-strikes or worse), criminal countermeasures for copyright infringement, even if not for profit, the change in the [status of mere conduit](http://blog.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/?p=2735) for the intermediaries, the suppression of any exception for the circumvention of protection and the prohibition to promotion of interoperability.

The document highlights some of the most striking contrasts between the legal framework of the Union and ACTA. We note that these contrasts, in accordance with Article 300 TEC (replaced since the 1st of December by art. 218 TFEU) **force the European negotiators to fully and promptly inform the European Parliament**. This information has not been hitherto provided, despite a resolution to that effect adopted by the EP itself. Furthermore, art. 207 TFEU (previously art. 133 TEC) states that **"The Council and the Commission shall be responsible for ensuring that the agreements negotiated are compatible with internal Union policies and rules".**

We are therefore obliged to take into consideration the fact that the EU negotiators are conducting secret negotiations in violation of existing treaties. In any case incompatibility with the European legal framework gives the Parliament the power to intervene and authority (always in under Articles above) to reject ACTA timely.

Let's see, according to the negotiators themselves, the incompatibility points between ACTA and the European legal framework:

1\. The American proposal provides both civil and criminal copyright enforcement. These provisions **violate the WIPO treaties and the [Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:167:0010:0019:IT:PDF)**, which refers to "adequate legal protection" without specifying what that protection should consist of. In addition, the **[e-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC](http://blog.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/?p=2735)** applies to all areas of legislative provisions relating to service providers of the information society, without distinction between public, private and criminal laws. The negotiators point out that "It is not clear how the US proposal interprets this, if at all"

2\. Negotiators will reserve the right to inquire further about any problems with the universal service and users' rights Directive 2002/22/EC recently adopted by Council and Parliament (note that strangely negotiators refer to it with "consumers' rights directive", which is not the correct name).

We refer to [our analysis]() on a part of the Framework Directive 2002/21/EC (Trautmann report) and a part of the universal service Directive, from which **more incompatibilities with ACTA emerge**, specifically with art. 1.3a (prohibition of graduated response as understood by ACTA) of the first and with articles 21.3 (b) and 20.1 (b) of the second.

3\. The paragraph on the "General Obligations" establishes that procedures for enforcement are "effective" and that the remedies are "rapid" and "constitute a deterrent to further infringements". This formulation is a **violation of TRIPs art. 41, WCT art. 14 and IPRED [(2004/48/EC)](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/pri/en/oj/dat/2004/l_195/l_19520040602en00160025.pdf) art. 3**. Indeed, although the similar wording, ACTA remove the provision that the procedures shall be "fair, equitable and/or proportionate" in relation to, for example, an alleged infringer.

Please note that the cancellation of those words leads to an imbalance and unfair power to copyright and patent holders and can justify the repressive measures against the alleged offenders, such as the graduated response or even worse, without the need of the burden of proof from the prosecution. This omission is also keen to justify measures not proportionate within a democratic society (such as, for example, the restriction or suppression of fundamental rights on the basis of vague suspicions advanced by copyright holder).

The negotiators point out that similar observations were made in the past also on the civil provisions of ACTA, and suggest a reformulation to achieve compatibility with the TRIPs.

4\. The negotiators expresse concern about the paragraph concerning intermediary liability. First they ask why this intermediary liability is extended only to the case of copyright and patent and trademarks. Then they highlight the lack of definition of the circumstances leading to such liability and point out that the provisions related seem to refer to the concept of what in some Member States is called **"contributory copyright infringement". This concept does not exist in the legal framework of the Union** and therefore a provision to that effect would go beyond the Acquis communautaire. Negotiators argue that, however, Member States have reached an agreement on criminal law based on the words "incite, aid and abetting". We will investigate this claim.

5\. ACTA obliges the ISPs, as a prerequisite to keep the status of mere conduit, to implement a policy to avoid "the unauthorized storage and/or transmission of copyrighted material". The burden of specific provisions in order to obtain the mere conduit status **goes beyond the Acquis communautaire.**

6\. An example of a reasonable policy advanced by ACTA in order for ISPs to maintain their mere conduit status is the automatic disconnection of their own customers (graduated response, then we learn here that graduated response would be de facto mandatory for ISPs). The negotiators point out that the graduated response is an ongoing negotiation between the Council and European Parliament within the Telecoms Package. The document is in fact prior to the end of that negotiation. In light of framework Directive (2002/21/EC) art. 1.3a, **provisions requiring ISPs application of graduated response and the automatic disconnection of users are incompatible with the EU legal framework.**

7\. The negotiators rightly point out that mandatory notice-and-takedown procedures **violate the e-Commerce Directive (2000/31/EC)**, which does not consider these measures as essential to maintain the status of mere conduit. Please note that under the U.S. DMCA, notice-and-takedown is a request for a content removal from those who claim to hold copyright on that content. Usually such requests are processed automatically without verification, laying the foundations for a real system of private censorship.

8\. Civil and criminal provisions for breaches of DRM protections or other content protection systems, extending even against the circumvention of technical measures which prevent **any** access to content, are **incompatible with the WCT, the WPPT and Article 6 (3) of the CISD (Directive 2001/29/EC).**

9\. The **prohibition** that ACTA would impose against the possibility **to encourage interoperability**, finally, **appears outside the Acquis communautaire**: Directive CISD and CSD **promote interoperability** leaving to the Member States to decide forms and implementation of such encouragement. **For consumers**, a prohibition in this regard **would be highly detrimental**, because it would put an end to all efforts to allow them to enjoy the same content on different platforms and would give total freedom to manufacturers (in synergy with the prohibition of any security breaches, without exception) to "close" even more their systems (a typical example of interoperability is related to the possibility of seeing the same movie or listen to the music itself, lawfully purchased, on different machines, different PCs, different readers, etc...)

**Conclusions**

Putting aside for now the potential problems with the fundamental rights of citizens and constitutional Charters of EU Member States, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the new [Directive 2009/24/EC](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:111:0016:0022:EN:PDF) (\*), the document written by European negotiators themselves shows that **ACTA is incompatible with at least 3 international treaties and five (5) European Directives (\*\*)**; furthemore negotiations were conducted in apparent **violation of at least 2 articles in the TFEU.**

These extremely serious reasons are more than enough to demand an immediate cessation of the negotiations in order to allow full parliamentary scrutiny by the EP and to let all parties that will be heavily affected by ACTA, including citizens, consumers and Internet Service Provider, the study and evaluation of documents (as indeed it is normal practice for all treaties related to intellectual property) and the opportunity to enter actively in the process of negotiations.

**If it were not possible to obtain a suspension of negotiations, the Council and the Commission have an obligation enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon on moving the European Union from the negotiation process and not to sign the agreement.**

(\*) Special attention should be placed about ACTA being incompatible with Article 6 and Article 7, in the spirit of recital 15 and recital 16.
